1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
   A) A website is divided into two main components: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the visible part of the website that users interact with, such as the design, layout, and functionality. In contrast, the back-end is the part of the website that is not visible to users and includes the server-side code, database, and web application framework. The front-end and back-end work together to provide a seamless user experience. When a user interacts with the front-end, their actions are sent to the back-end, which processes the request and returns the necessary data to update the front-end. Both components are essential for a website to function correctly.

2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.
   A) HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. There are three main categories of tags: structural, formatting, and interactive.

Structural tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` define the layout and structure of the page. These tags help organize the content on the page, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand.

Formatting tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<em>` help format the text on the page. These tags allow you to add headings, paragraphs, bold and italic text, underlined text, and line breaks, among other things.

Interactive tags like `<a>`, `<form>`, and `<input>` create interactive elements on the page. These tags allow you to create links, forms, buttons, input fields, dropdown menus, and text areas, among other things.

By using a combination of these tags, you can create well-structured, formatted, and interactive web pages.
