1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
   A) A website is divided into two main components: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the visible part of the website that users interact with, such as the design, layout, and functionality. In contrast, the back-end is the part of the website that is not visible to users and includes the server-side code, database, and web application framework. The front-end and back-end work together to provide a seamless user experience. When a user interacts with the front-end, their actions are sent to the back-end, which processes the request and returns the necessary data to update the front-end. Both components are essential for a website to function correctly.

2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.
   A) HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. There are three main categories of tags: structural, formatting, and interactive.

   Structural tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` define the layout and structure of the page. These tags help organize the content on the page, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand.

   Formatting tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<em>` help format the text on the page. These tags allow you to add headings, paragraphs, bold and italic text, underlined text, and line breaks, among other things.

   Interactive tags like `<a>`, `<form>`, and `<input>` create interactive elements on the page. These tags allow you to create links, forms, buttons, input fields, dropdown menus, and text areas, among other things.

   By using a combination of these tags, you can create well-structured, formatted, and interactive web pages.

3. Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.
   A) The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that is used to keep track of changes made to the web page. When a change is made to the web page, the Virtual DOM compares the new version of the page with the previous version and identifies the specific changes that were made.

   Then, the Virtual DOM updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, rather than re-rendering the entire page. This reduces the amount of work required to update the web page, resulting in improved performance and faster load times.

4. Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL.
   A) MySQL is a relational database that stores data in tables and uses SQL for querying. NoSQL is a non-relational database that stores data in collections or documents and uses a variety of query languages. NoSQL databases are often more scalable than MySQL and sacrifice data consistency for improved performance. MySQL is often used for traditional web applications, while NoSQL is used for big data applications and real-time analytics. The choice between MySQL and NoSQL depends on the specific needs of the application.

5. Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.
   A) One popular DBMS technology is MySQL, a relational database management system. MySQL is a relational database, which means that data is stored in tables with defined relationships between them. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. MySQL supports a wide range of data types, including numeric, text, date, and time data. MySQL is known for its scalability, reliability, and performance. Overall, MySQL is a powerful and flexible DBMS technology that is well-suited for web applications and other data-intensive applications.
